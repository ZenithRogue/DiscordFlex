"Do Almost Whatever the Fuck You Want, But Don't Sell This, or I Will Unleash A Plague Upon Your House"

1. **Definitions:**
   - "The Work" means the stuff you're getting under this license.
   - "You" and "Your" means the person or entity about to step into this agreement.

2. **What You Can Do:**
   - The licensor grants You a global, free-of-charge, non-exclusive, forever license to do whatever the heck you want with The Work, including using, copying, changing, and sharing it in any way, as long as you don't try to sell it in any capacity.

3. **You Better Not:**
   - Don't even think about selling, renting, leasing, sublicensing, or making a single dime off The Work. Seriously, don't.
   - Don't claim you made The Work or lie about where it came from.

4. **Or Else...:**
   - Mess this up, and the licensor will unleash a plague upon your house.

5. **No Promises:**
   - The Work is given to you "as is". Don't come crying if it's not perfect or doesn't do what you thought it would.

6. **Not Our Problem:**
   - The licensor isn't liable for squat. If something goes wrong, it's on you.

7. **Don't Screw Up:**
   - If you mess up and break these rules, consider this license null and void.
